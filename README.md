What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

getElementById: Returns the element with the specified id. Since IDs should be unique, it always returns a single element.

getElementsByClassName: Returns a live HTMLCollection of all elements with the specified class name. The collection updates automatically if the DOM changes.

querySelector: Returns the first element that matches a given CSS selector (e.g., #id, .class, div > p).

querySelectorAll: Returns a static NodeList of all elements matching the CSS selector. Unlike getElementsByClassName, this list does not update automatically.
